Objectss are data structures that can hold many values, but unlike arrays values in objects have a name or key to reference their variable, AKA a property or their methods.
These are known as key value pairs.

initializing an object is also known as an object literal

Objects require three things:
1. a name
2. a set of keys
3. keys corresponding values

Objects use {} to enclose their key value pairs.

example:
let objectName = {
    key1: value1,
    key2: value2,
    key3: value3
    //this can be repated for as many values as we need in an object. Key calue pairs must be seperated by commas
}   // and when using multiline, be careful about spaces and tabs

Keys must be valid JavaScript strings

a property is a key/value pair of an object.
a method performs an action on the object, as it is one of its defined functions

we can refer to values inside of an object by using this.key; you can also reference the object itself - objectName.key

There are two ways to access the value of any object - bracket syntaax and dot notation

bracket syntax = objectName["key"]

dot notation = objectname.key

if referring to a key that includes a space, we must use bracket syntax, as it is a string value.

object values are mutable.
This means we are changing the property, destroying its original value.

Example of mutating an objects value:
   let tortoiseOne = {
       species: "Galapagos Tortoise",
       name: "Pete",
       weight: 919,
       age: 85,
       diet: ["pumpkins", "lettuce", "cabbage"]
   };

   console.log(tortoiseOne.weight); //prints original value of 919

   newWeight = tortoiseOne.weight + 10;

   tortoiseOne["weight"] = newWeight;

   console.log(tortoiseOne["weight"]); // prints new value of 929

We can also add new key/value pairs:
objectName["new-key"] = propertyValue

we must use bracket notation to add a key/value pair.

THE MATH OBJECT;
Math is a built in object, adn it values cannot be changed or mutated, all built in objects cannot be modified,

Math object has 8 properties:
1. Pi(3.14......) Math.PI
2. The square root of 2; Math.SQRT2

The Math object conatins over 30 methods, here are some of the most frequently used;
Math.abs(number) = Returns the positive value of number;
Math.ceil(number) = rounds the decimmal number UP to the closest integer
Math.floor(number) = rounds the decimal number DOWN to the enarest integer.
Math.max(x,y,z,...) = Returns the largest value from a set of numbers;
Math.min(x,y,z,...) = returns the smallest value from a set of numbers;
Math.pow(x,y) = Returns the value of x rasied to the power of y;
Math.random() = returns a random decimal value between 0 and 1, NOT including 1
Math.round(number) = Returns number rounded to the nearest integer value
math.sqrt(number) = returns the square root of number;
Math.trunc(number) = Removes any decimals, and returns the integer part of number;

Math methods are often combined in order to achieve different results when needed

To select random item from array we can use Math.floor(Math.random()*array.length), we can pass this as an index and it will return a random value from 0 to the last index of the array.

We can round to different amounts oof decimal places by multiplying and dividing by the decimal position.
if we want two decimals we will multiply by 100 within the round method, and divide that value by 100 outside of the method.
This is increasable referring to the 10, 100ths, thousandths, ten-thousandths, ad infinium by multiplying and then dividing by that number.

Math.round(1.23*10) / 10 //this will return 1.2
