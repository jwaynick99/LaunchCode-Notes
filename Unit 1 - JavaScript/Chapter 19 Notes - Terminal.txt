TERMINAL;
GUI - graphical user interface - a system designed with icones and visual representations of the machines file system.

CLI - Command LinE interface - uses textual commands rather than drag and drops known in GUIs.

The application used to run CLI is called a terminal. and the prgram interpreting the commans is the shell.
command line, terminal and shell are often used interchangeably.

terminal can quickly move throught file structures, make new files and directories, remove items from folders, install software, open programs, and run programs directly.

file system - a structure for the computer to store files and folder that make upo the data of the operating system.

inside a filesystem, folder are known as directories, adn folder inside folders are known as subdirectories.

a root directory refers tot he top most directory of a given system. In windows: the C drive. in MAC denoted as the "/"

root directory is the parent directory of the folder insdie of it.

a path is the list of files and folders a computer goes through to find particular items.

absolute path is the path taken from the root directory.
relative path is the pathj taken to a file form your current directory.

we can use ".." for move up into a parent directory. while "." pulls from the same directory our file is in.

the prompt lets us know that the terminal is rady to accept commands. 
//prompt example
LaunchCode-Super-Computer:~ lcstaffmember$
"Launchcode-Super-Computer" is the name of the computer.
"~" tells us we are currently iniside the home directory.
"lcstaffmember" is the username of the person who was logged onto the terminal.
"$" - we type our commands after this

the terminal rarely denotes when the directory is changed, thus we must keep an eye on the files path in our prompt.

terminal commands:
ls - lists all files and folders in the current directory
cd <new-directory> - change directory, navigates from current directory to new-directory
pwd - prints the path of the curretn directory
mkdir <new-folder> - mkae new-folder inside the current directory
touch <new-file> - creates new-file inside current directory
rm  <old file> - removes old file from the current directory.
man <command> - prints to the screen the current manual pages for the command.
clear - empties the terminal window of prevvious commands and outputs.
cp <source path> <target path> - copies the file or directory at source to target.
mv < source> <target> moves the file or directory from source to target.

"~" goes to home directory
"." the current directory
".." parent directory of current directory

pressing "ctrl-c" will terminate currently running code.
exit command accmomplishes the same
