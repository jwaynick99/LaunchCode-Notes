Review:
for/while loop - a piece of code that iterates over and over again following its own patterns, base upon a designated condition.
initialization, condition, updater
for (let i =0; i < n; i++)

a pure function - a functions that always has the same input and output; self contained; does not have side effects.

impure function - a function that changes based upon outside variable; has side effects.

named functions - functions functionName(parameters){ function body }
anonymous functions - function(parameters){function body} (this can be set to a variable, or be used as a functions argument)

FUNCTIONS AS OBJECTS;
functions can be passed just like variables and data.
a function being called can be used as a function argument to carry out its process.

let is a reserved keyword; declares a variable
let num;
num = 0;
console.log(typeof num)
//this prints data type of the variable num = number


function updateValue() {
    //function body
}

object.property or object.method() "." in this instance refers to object modifier.

i++ is the same as i = i + 1

recursion = a funnction that calls itself; breaks down a task into smaller and smaller pieces until it completes a task in its simplest form.

arrow functions:
const factorial = () => {
    if (f === 0) {
        return 1; 
    } else {
        return f * factorial(f - 1)
    }
}

^^^this is honestly a bad example^^^
