REVIEW;
delcarative/imperative paradigm, delcarative is tell our prgogram step by step what we want it to do with specific instruction, imperative is giving a general task

class will by default make a construcotr method inside of itself.
when we use typeof ClassName, it will returen a function, becasue the constructor is the maker of a class object.

typeof an object made using a class object will return typeof object

primitive data types, num, str, boolean, symbol, big int, null and undefined

we can create empty objects, using empty classes, and then add key values pairs using bracket syntax or dot notation

we can look at the key/value pair in classes like this.key = value, value usually being passed through as a parameter of the class

function calling itself from inside of itself ic alled recursion.

holding a function within a constructor will cause the object to call the function upon creation of the object, adn stores it with the specific object.
while defining the function outsiode of the construcotr allow us to call the same method for all objects created usign that class.

TERMINAL;

a terminal is a text input/outptu environment, acts a wrapper to input commands the computer will process.

npm init will initialiaze a new package.json file in our directory

HTML;
Hypertext Markup Language
inside of an HTML file we can just type "!" and it will give is a basic HTML layout boiler plate file layout

Burger analogy for HTML. html tag covers whole file, head tag contains info for the file, body tag contains the contetns of our page to be dsiplayed.

inline -initializing style or other attirbute inside atag, external referencing another file for attribute, or internal - referencing things in the header.

inline styles are first priority, and will overwrite any external or internal references.

things put into the head of our file will run before the page body is fully loaded.
