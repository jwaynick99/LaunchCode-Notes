Gradle:
    Gradle is an automated build tool and can handle:
        Managing dependencies,
        Testing protocols,
        Packaging the executable program for deployment.

    A gradle build Represents one or more projects. 
    Projects are created from a series of tasks.

    Gradle manages tasks based on the fuunction in the build, and organizes them into the build.gradle file.

    build.gradle:
        is the project build script, and will be referred to as gradle runs through the task list to build the app.

        If using external tasks, we build task methods to gorup tasks by functionallity. 

        Tasks get called to build our project.

    task and plugins:
        often tasks will be imported from an external resource as "plugins"

        Plugins contain any necessary tasks and scripts to extend a projects capabilities.

        Plugins often need dependencies and external repos.

    dependencies:  
        external code libraries used by tasks to build our project.

        Gradle will often group related dependencies into conifgurations.

    configuration:
        a method that bundles dependencies together based on the role.

        configurations can extend from one another, reducing redundancy.

    repositories:
        Often contains abstracted source code for dependencies

        build.gradle file links up with repositories using the repositories method.

    Windows users can use ctrl-shift-o to refresh a gradle build.
