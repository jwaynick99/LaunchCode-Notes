When we visit a web page, three main steps happen:
1. The browser sends a request to the server for the webpage
2. The server responds with the cdoe that makes up the webpage
3. The browser takes the code and renders it to present the webpage the the code creates

When the browser renders the page, HTML outlines the structure of the pages content

HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

Hyper text is text tthat includes references to other text that is known as hyperlinks.

Coding languages include a family called markup languages, they annotate the text of a document and define the structure

Two main components of HTML are tags and elements. These define the structure of content.

An element is a segment of an HTML page, often broken down by content type.

A tag is the syntax for the computer processes to determine the type of content of an html element.
Tags surround the content within the element. So, we always need <opening> and </closing> tags.

<element type> this can include additional specification aout the elements appearance.
closing tags require / after the beginning bracket. </closing>

<element type>content</element type> 

Semantic HTML is about the specific meaning of the elements.
Some examples of semantic HTML tags are: <p>, <h1>, <h2>, and <div>.

5 rules of writing html:
1. Every html files needs a DOCTYPE tag. specifying the HTML version used. When using the current version of HTML, thew doctype is <!DOCTYPE html> this is on of the few tags that does not require a closing tag.

2. the <html> tag denotes the beginning and end of the html the programmer has written.

3. the <head> tag contains data about the web page

4. the <body> tag contains evreything that appears on the page on the document.

5. the <title> tag goes in the <head> of the document, adn browsers require it. It gives the webpage a title that appears in the tab.

example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>My Web Page</title>
      content
   </head>
   <body>
      content
   </body>
</html>

the <head> includes links to other files adn other data about the document. browsers do not display content in the head.
the head also contans styling, using css.

the <body> contains the content to be displayed on the webpage. images, text and code samples.

an html comment <!-- comment here --> <= the worst comment syntax.

indentation and spacing can alter the way renders the page in rare instances

TAGS TO KNOW:
Bold:	<b>	When surrounding text, makes that text bold.
Emphasis:	<em>	When surrounding text, makes that text italic.
Hyperlink:	<a>	Creates hyperlinks.
Image:	<img>	Denotes images.
Break:	<br>	A single line break.
Paragraph:	<p>	Creates a paragraph in text.
Section:	<span>	Makes a section in text.
Division:	<div>	Defines an area of the page.
Form:	<form>	Creates a form for user input.
Unordered List:	<ul>	Creates an unordered list.
Ordered List:	<ol>	Creates an ordered list.
List element:	<li>	Denotes an element of the list. This tag is used for both ordered and unordered lists.
Table:	<table>	Creates a table on the page.
Heading Level One:	<h1>	Creates a heading in the text. - headings can go from h1 to h6, with h2 being subheading of h1, and so on.
                                                            headings by default decrease in size the deeper they go.

rule of thumb is to use only one h1 in an html doc, adn do not skip headin sizes to reduce size of headings.

example using tags for a basic html site:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Plant-Loving Astronauts</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Space Plants Are Cool</h1>
      <p>NASA discovers that plants can live in <b>outer space</b>. More innovations from this discovery to follow.</p>
      <!-- add images from NASA of these space plants -->
   </body>
</html>

we can add attributes to tags for further specifications  about the elements appearance. examples include alignemtn or alternate text to an image.

   <element attribute = "value">content</element>

we include our attribute before the closing bracket in our opening tag.

attribute example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Plant-Loving Astronauts</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Space Plants Are Cool</h1>
      <p>NASA discovers that plants can live in <b>outer space</b>. More innovations from this discovery to follow.</p>
      <img src = "space-flower.jpg" alt = "Flower floating in space.">
      <!-- This image was taken by NASA and is in the Public Domain -->
   </body>
</html>

the img tag has two attributes, source <src> adn alternative <alt> source denotes the image being used, while alt should describe the image concisely.
