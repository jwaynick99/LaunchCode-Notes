CLASSES;
Hwat are classes?
Classes are templates for creating onjects, They encapuslate data with code to work on that data.

classes in JS are actually built with prototypes, a mechanism by which JS objects inherit features from one another.

imperative - paradigm describing HOW the program should to something, by explicitly specifying each instruction step-by-step. which will mutate the program's state.
declaritive - a paradigm decsribing WHAT the program does, wihtout explicitly specifying it control flow.

class needs a constructor method, these are parameters to pass into an object made using class.
inside of our constructor method we use parameters to assign properties to our class object.

we use a this.property during assignment to assign property to a specific object during declaration of new class object.
INHERITANCE:
class ChildClass extends ParentClass { // extends notes to interpreter we are pulling constructor from a parent class
   constructor () { //constructor will be passed parameters from parent class, and then passed through to child SUPER
      super(); // we must use super to pass properties from parent class
      // properties
   }
}

example with 2 sub classes of parent class:
class Felidae {
   constructor() {
      this.claws = "retractable";
   }
}

class Panthera extends Felidae {
   constructor() {
      super();
      this.roar = "loud";
   }
}

class Tiger extends Panthera {
   constructor() {
      super();
      this.hasStripes = "true";
   }
}

let tigger = new Tiger();

console.log(tigger);
