Review;
a pure function - a function given the same input is giicing the same output, does not have side effects.

a module - the abstraction part of OOP, a modular piece of code that is exported and imported into code.

Why test your code;
To avoid bugs, checking for different use cases which may throw errors.
Find regressions. Regression testing - 
Test and Documentation.

Intro to Jest;
npm init in console will create a pakage.json
touch (filename).js will create a new file

JS most often uses  index.js for main project folder, which should hold reference to all other code files in your project.

npm can be used to install dependencies : npm install --save-dev test

package.json scripts needs to contain key value pair of "test": "jest"

the root file is the base folder of your project. package.json and other files are located here.

What is jest;
Jest is a unit-testing framework

describe string should describe what were testing, often the project name.

describe function takes the description string and the function for all tests.

test functions = test("test string, should often contain 'should'", function(){
    test body.
})

test file needs to import file holding the functions(s) we are testing.

test function should be passed expect(the received return) function and toBe(the expected return) function. This is general framework for Jest.
