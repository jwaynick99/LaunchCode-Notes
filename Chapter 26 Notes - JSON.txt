API;
APIs - application programming interface. 
Programs use APIs to communicate with other programs. 

APIs use data formats in order to keep requests consistent, sometimes the language requesting data may be different from the language responding to the request.
A data format is a set of rules that govern how data is written, organized and labeled. 

JSON;
JavaScript Object Notation - JS data format, most common format for web applications.
Uses JS object syntax, with some changes.

example:
{
   "title": "An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth",
   "author": "Chris Hadfield",
   "ISBN": 9780316253017,
   "year_published": 2013,
   "subject": ["Hadfield, Chris", "Astronauts", "Biography"],
   "available": true
}

JSON Rules;
JSON is a collection of key/value pairs. 
in example above title key has the value of "An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth"
JSON keys MUST be strings, but the value can be string, number, bool, array, object or null.

JSON can also be a collection of objects, example:
{
   "hits": 3,
   "book": [
      {
         "title": "An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth",
            "author": "Chris Hadfield",
            "ISBN": 9780316253017,
            "year_published": 2013,
            "subject": ["Hadfield, Chris", "Astronauts", "Biography"],
            "available": true
      },
      {
         "title": "Astronaut",
         "author": "Lucy M. George",
         "ISBN": 9781609929411,
         "year_published": 2016,
         "subject": ["Astronauts", "Juvenile Fiction", "Space stations"],
         "available": false
      },
      {
         "title": "Astronaut Ellen Ochoa",
         "author": "Heather E. Schwartz",
         "ISBN": 9781512434491,
         "year_published": 2018,
         "subject": ["Ochoa Ellen", "Women astronauts", "Astronauts", "Biography", "Women scientists", "Hispanic American women"],
         "available": true
      }
   ]
}

each book from this array can be found with the key "book"
When requesting to an API it will format that data we requested into JSON, and then respond to our request with the JSON representation.

JSON object differences;
keys and string values MUST be in double quotes, JSON strings require doubles quotes to be considered a string.
